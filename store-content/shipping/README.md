# Shipping weights and box sizes (28 Sep 2026)

`product-weights.csv` has a shipping weight, packed box size and shipping method for every variant in the store (1,691 variants, 1,539 of them live). `estimate_weights.py` builds it from a Shopify product export.

## Where the numbers come from
None of our suppliers publish shipping weights. Roberts Designs, Bathroom City (MELA) and Eternity Tiles were all checked. So every weight is an estimate. Sizes come from the product description or title where they are given (vanity width, bath length, basin dimensions, trim length, blade diameter, pack count). The weight then follows from the material. The `basis` column says which source was used for each row.

Check a few against real parcels. The ones most worth weighing are vanities, baths, shower screens, mirrors and tile cutters.

## Columns
- `weight_kg`: packed weight of one unit. Tiles are per m².
- `box_cm`: packed box, longest side first.
- `cubic_kg`: Australia Post cubic weight (L×W×H ÷ 4000). Couriers charge the higher of this and the real weight.
- `ship_by`: `auspost` if it fits a MyPost Business parcel (22 kg, 105 cm longest side, 0.25 m³), otherwise `freight`. Tiles are always freight.
- `in_shopify`: whether the weight has been entered on the Shopify variant.

## Summary (live variants)
| Ship by | Variants | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| auspost | 956 | tapware, accessories, silicone, grout up to 10 kg, tools, spacers, blades, basins, sinks up to 770 mm, most mirrors, tile cutters up to 84 cm, 1 m trims, linear drains up to 900 mm |
| freight | 583 | 3 m and 2.5 m trims, tiles, vanities, baths, toilets, shower screens, tallboys, mirror cabinets over 22 kg, large mirrors, cutters 95 cm and up, Kera Cut/Lift, Baron mixers, linear drains 1200 mm+ |

156 live variants are in "Local delivery or pickup - large items" but fit Australia Post: basins, kitchen sinks, mirrors, grout, niche boxes, floor wastes, freestanding bath mixers/spouts and small tile cutters. These can be sold Australia-wide once they move to a parcel shipping profile. Ceramic and glass items are marked fragile.

3 m trims are light (under 4 kg) but too long for Australia Post, so they need a courier that takes long parcels. Until then they are Perth delivery or pickup.

## Status
Weights are entered in Shopify for all 1,691 variants (checked against a fresh Shopify export on 28 Sep 2026: all match). They don't change what customers pay until calculated shipping rates are turned on.

## Australia Post parcels profile (28 Sep 2026)
New delivery profile **"Australia Post parcels - bulky items"** (gid://shopify/DeliveryProfile/94542069823), zone Australia (all states), rate = live Australia Post MyPost Business prices from the connected account, all services, no handling fee.

184 variants (156 live) moved into it from "Local delivery or pickup - large items": basins, kitchen sinks, mirrors, LED mirrors, small mirror cabinets, grout, niche boxes, floor wastes and linear drains up to 900 mm, freestanding bath mixers/spouts, tile cutters up to 84 cm and small Sigma parts. Pickup and Perth local delivery still apply (they are set on the location).

Small items stay in the General profile ($20 under $100, free from $100). A mixed cart pays both: the small-item rate plus the Australia Post price for the bulky item.

Parcel Post and Express Post were switched on for this rate on 28 Sep 2026 (the rate had no services selected).

### Storefront test (28 Sep 2026, cart shipping-rate lookup)
| Cart | Address | Rates returned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Silicone $17.40 | Maddington 6109 | Standard $20, Local Delivery $130 |
| Basin mixer $259 | Sydney 2000 | Free shipping |
| Basin $315 | Sydney 2000 / Darwin 0800 | none |
| Basin $315 | Maddington 6109 | Local Delivery $130 |
| Silicone + basin | Melbourne 3000 | none |

Australia Post returns no rates for any item in the profile, even a 0.35 kg primer, so the cause is the account setup, not the weights. The likely causes are no default package in Shopify, or a MyPost Business connection that isn't finished. Until that's fixed, these items still sell as pickup or Perth delivery only, the same as before the move.

Still to do by the owner in Shopify admin: $100 local delivery minimum (the $17.40 test still shows $130), a default package size, and checking the Australia Post connection.
